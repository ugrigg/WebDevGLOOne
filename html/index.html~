				<ul>
					<li>Do you enjoy quality crafted cofee?</li>
					<li>Is spending $10.00 on a cup of cofee a bargain to you?</li>
					<li>Do you like your barista having a PhD in Fine Arts?</li>
					<li>Is being looked down upon enjoyable to you?<li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>
				If you answered yes to any of those questions then visiting your local hipster coffee
				shop can make for a very enjoyable birthday activity. It is always nice to treat yourself 
				to something a bit pricey once in a while. And if you're lucky you can even feel like you 
				are splurging by the stares of the stuck-up baristas when you ask for a random cup of coffee
				withou specifing what temperature you want it brewed at the the thousandth decimal place.

				You know that "Ye Olde Cheese Shoppe" place you always pass in your grocery store but
				never buy anything from? Now that it is your birthday you can ditch the 75% plastic 
				Kraft slices and buy some real cheese. Get some brie or gouda, hell buy a whole wheel
				of the stuff if you want, it's your birthday. Though there are some steps you have 
				to follow  to truly enjoy these cheeses.
			</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Buy the most expensive one you can!</li>
					<li>Brag about it on social media</li>
					<li>Do an "unboxing," it's all the rage</li>
					<li>Pics or it didnt happen</li>
					<li>After eating, realize how lonely you are to be eating 
					    artisanal cheese alone on your birthday</li>
