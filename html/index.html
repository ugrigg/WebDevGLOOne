			<h2>#1 Relaxing With Some Nice Coffee</h2>
			<img class="centeredImage" src="../img/hipster.jpg" alt="hipster brewing coffee">
			<div class="centeredList">
				<ul>
					<li>Do you enjoy quality crafted cofee?</li>
					<li>Is spending $10.00 on a cup of cofee a bargain to you?</li>
					<li>Do you like your barista having a PhD in Fine Arts?</li>
					<li>Is being looked down upon enjoyable to you?<li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>
				If you answered yes to any of those questions then visiting your local hipster coffee
				shop can make for a very enjoyable birthday activity. It is always nice to treat yourself 
				to something a bit pricey once in a while. And if you're lucky you can even feel like you 
				are splurging by the stares of the stuck-up baristas when you ask for a random cup of coffee
				withou specifing what temperature you want it brewed at the the thousandth decimal place.

			<h2>#2 Enjoy Artisanal Cheese</h2>
			<img class="centeredImage" src="../img/cheese.jpg" alt="artisanal cheese">
			<p>
				You know that "Ye Olde Cheese Shoppe" place you always pass in your grocery store but
				never buy anything from? Now that it is your birthday you can ditch the 75% plastic 
				Kraft slices and buy some real cheese. Get some brie or gouda, hell buy a whole wheel
				of the stuff if you want, it's your birthday. Though there are some steps you have 
				to follow  to truly enjoy these cheeses.
			</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Buy the most expensive one you can!</li>
					<li>Brag about it on social media</li>
					<li>Do an "unboxing," it's all the rage</li>
					<li>Pics or it didnt happen</li>
					<li>After eating, realize how lonely you are to be eating 
					    artisanal cheese alone on your birthday</li>
				</ol>

			<h2>#3 Hire A Clown</h2>
			<img id="clownPic" class="centeredImage" src="../img/clown.jpeg" alt="professional clown">
			<p>
			No matter how old you are every birthday needs a clown. My go to website is <a href="https://www.clowns.com/">https://www.clowns.com</a>.
			It is a great resource for all your clown needs; however, you may go to <a href="https://www.craigslist.com">craigslist</a> if you
			are strapped for cash, just don't expect quality clowning. Trust me, it's worth it.

			<h2>#4 Budget Your Money</h2>
			<img class="centeredImage.css" src="../img/money.jpg" alt="budgeting">
			<p>
				With all that birthday money coming in, now is a perfect time to make sure you don't spend it all,
				at least not all at once. Set up a simple budget, see how much you need for food, transportation, and
				other activities. I've included a sample one below.
			</p>
			<table>
				<caption>Weekly Budget</caption>
				<th>
					<td>Expenses</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td>Money</td>
				</th>
				<tr>
					<td>Groceries</td>
					<td>$50</td>
					<td></td>
					<td>Mom</td>
					<td>$250</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>"Soda Pop"</td>
					<td>$75</td>
					<td></td>
					<td>Dad</td>
					<td>$250</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Gas</td>
					<td>$50</td>
					<td></td>
					<td>Paycheck</td>
					<td>$500</td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Rent</td>
					<td>$400</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Totals</td>
					<td>$575</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td>$1000</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Leftover</td>
					<td>$425</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				This is a very simple budget, but as you grow older it can become much more complicated and heart-wrenching as your debts and expenses pile up. 
				But for now, enjoy life!.

			<h2>#5 Change Your Smoke Alarm Batteries</h2>
			<img class="centeredImage" src="../img/battery.jpg" alt="changing a smoke detector's batteries">
			<p>
				What birthday would be complete if you didn't change your smoke alarm's batteries? Though they may not
				make much of a difference if you live alone.
